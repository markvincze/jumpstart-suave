# Jumpstart Suave with Paket and FAKE

A minimal example of a project setup of a web application implemented with Suave and F#, using Paket and FAKE.

To start up the web app, simply clone the repo, execute `build.cmd`, then open `http://localhost:8080` in the browser.

This sample repo accompanies my [blog post about getting started with Suave on the .NET Framework](https://blog.markvincze.com/jumpstart-f-web-development-f-with-suave-io-on-classic-net/).
